## Notes

E_lepton denotes the lepton beam energy of the beam used in the experiment (measured at 5.75 GeV).  
The lepton type(s) used in this experiment were electrons and positrons.

The hadron used in the experiment was a proton, with a rest-energy constant of 0.938 GeV.

Both satisfy the ep⟶e′p′γ condition.  

Collaboration was done with the CEBAF large acceptance spectrometer (CLAS).

Data are taken from Figures 5 (page 5) of the paper.

Events are selected with exactly one photon producing an energy deposition larger than 5 GeV (1 MeV) in the calorimeter (preshower detector) and one charged track, identified as the scattered lepton

Some Kinematic requirments were imposed, covering 110 (Q2; xB; t) bins:  
- 1.0 < Q² < 4.6 (GeV)²   
- 0.10 < x_b < 0.58
- 0.09 < -t < 0.52 GeV^2
- W > 2 GeV

"A specially designed electromagnetic calorimeter [“inner calorimeter” (IC) [13]] was added to the CLAS detector and allowed the detection of photons for polar angles from about 5° to 16°, with full azimuthal coverage."

"the exclusivity of the ep → e'p'γ reactionwas ensured by applying 3σ cuts on the following four variables: the squared missing mass MM^2_{e'p'} of the (e'p'X) system, the coplanarity angle Δϕ, i.e., the angle between the (γ* p') and (γ* γ) planes, the missing transverse momentum of the (e'p'γ) system, and the angle θ_{γX} between the measured photon and that predicted by the kinematics of the (e'p'X) system."

## Tables 1 & 2 Overview

The tables are not in the pdf document so they will not be included in the document.

## Relation of Tables to Excel Sheets

There are 2 Excel Sheets total, based on the different bins and functions present in Figure 5. 

Each Excel Sheet is seperated based on 2 quantities: d^4σ_{UU} and Δ(d^4σ). The definitions for these values are found in the table below.

 **Table Column names and their corresponding Excel Sheet names**

average -t, x_B, or Q^2 values = t, xB, and Q2

Type of quantity used = obs

ϕ = phi

Amplitude of (corresponding quantity) = value

±δ(stat.) ±δ(syst.) are indicated as syst_u & stat_u
