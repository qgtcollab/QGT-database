## Notes
Experimental Description:
measured beam spin asymmetry in the deeply virtual Compton scattering off ⁴He using the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) at Jefferson Lab 

Beam: 
6 GeV longitudinally polarized electron beam incident on a pressurized ⁴He gaseous target

Objective: 
explore coherent DVCS on ⁴He to assess whether the predicted BSA increase could be observed, and to extract the ⁴He GPD

CLAS details:
- composed of six identical sectors separated by the coils of a toroidal magnet, with each sector made of four detectors 
- kinematics: three regions of drift chambers were placed between the torus magnet to reconstruct the charged particles’ tracks and calculate their momentum 
- an array of scintillators was placed behind the drift chambers to measure the precise time of flight for each track
- polar angle covered: 
   - 8 to 142°
- In the forward region, from 8 to 45°, these detectors were complemented with Cerenkov counters and electromagnetic calorimeters 

Photons from DVCS are mainly detected with the inner calorimeter.

Experimental cuts:
none since large energy deposit was dominantly from electrons and photons and could not be separated reliably

Selection cuts for two charged particles:
- selected events that contain:
   - single electron
   -  high-energy photon (E > 2 GeV)
   -  either a helium or a proton
   - Q² > 1 GeV²

Conclusion:
From the coherent (e⁴He → e'⁴He'γ') beam spin asymmetries data, extracted the real and imaginary parts of the only ⁴He Compton form factor, \mathcal{H}_A

This was the coherent electroproduction of a photon on helium e + ⁴He → e + γ + ⁴He at large 4-momentum transfer squared (Q²).
