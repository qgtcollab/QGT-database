## Notes

E_lepton denotes the lepton beam energy of the beam used in the experiment (measured at 27.6 GeV).  
The lepton type(s) used in this experiment were both electrons and positrons.

The hadron used in the experiment was a proton, with a rest-energy constant of 0.938 GeV.

Both satisfy the ep↑ → e′γp′ condition.  

Collaboration was done with HERMES spectrometer, as well as using the HERA accelerator at DESY. The final data set with the transversely polarised target
was collected over the years 2002-2005

Data are taken from Table 1 (page 22) of the paper.  

Some Kinematic requirments were imposed:  
- 1 < Q2 < 10 (GeV/c)²  
- 0.03 < x_b < 0.35
- v < 22 GeV  

The recoiling proton was not detected. Hence exclusive, events are selected by requiring the missing mass M_X next to the reaction ep → eγX
- an angle cut 5mrad < theta_(γ*γ) < 45mrad  
- a missing-mass-squared cut –1.5 < M_X² < 1.7 (GeV/c²)²    

The missing-mass squared cut is the exclusive region for the positron data.

The -t bin column in the table is not included in any of the excel sheets. However, these are restrictions places on -t to seperate the values into different bins, with the other values in the rows being the respective average kinematic values.

The value of t in the exclusive region is calculated as

$$t \;=\;
\frac{-\,Q^2 \;-\; 2\,\nu\Bigl(\nu \;-\;\sqrt{\nu^2 + Q^2}\,\cos\theta_{\gamma^*\gamma}\Bigr)}{1 \;+\;\frac{1}{M}\Bigl(\nu \;-\;\sqrt{\nu^2 + Q^2}\,\cos\theta_{\gamma^*\gamma}\Bigr)}$$

Exclusive events are selected with −t < 0.7 GeV^2 in order to reduce background.

The up-quark total angular momentum, J_u, and down-quark total angular momentum, J_d, are taken into consideration.

J_u is set at 4 different fixed values (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) while J_d is fixed at 0.

Although this model fails to describe the data for Asin(φ−φS)UT,DVCS , the model shows that Asin(φ−φS)UT,DVCS , Asin(φ−φS) cos φUT,Iand Asin(φ−φS)UT,I have significant sensitivity to J_u.

There are two models used to represent J_u and J_d through equations 7.1(double-distribution model) and 7.2(dual-parameterisation model) in the paper respectively.

Here is **Table 1** (condensed.)

All of the different bins are split into the Excel Sheets. There are 18 Excel Sheets split into the 3 different respective bins (-t, x_B, and Q^2). Each of these 3 bins are then further seperated into 6 categories, based off of the different azimuthal‐asymmetry amplitudes, extracted by fitting the φ-dependence of both the 

- **Beam-Charge Asymmetry** \(A_C(\phi)\)  
  - Constant term: \(A_C^{\cos(0\phi)}\)  
  - First harmonic: \(A_C^{\cos\phi}\)

and the

- **Transverse-Target-Spin Asymmetry** \(A_{UT}\), split into:  
  - **Pure DVCS** part \(\,A_{UT,\mathrm{DVCS}}\) with its \(\sin(\phi - \phi_S)\) moment  
  - **Interference** part \(A_{UT,I}\) with moments  
    - \(\sin(\phi - \phi_S)\)  
    - \(\sin(\phi - \phi_S)\cos\phi\)  
    - \(\cos(\phi - \phi_S)\sin\phi\)

## Table 2 Overview

Table 2 is essentially a breakdown of the systematic-uncertainty contributions.

You can find the detailed breakdown of the systematic‐uncertainty contributions (Table 2) in **Section 4.2: “Background corrections and systematic uncertainties”**

> “The other sources are associated with the background correction, calorimeter calibration and the relative shift of the _MX_^2 spectra between the positron and electron data. These contributions, given in Table 2, are added in quadrature to form the total systematic uncertainty per kinematic bin, appearing in Table 1.”  

The four individual uncertainty sources listed in Table 2 are:

- **MX² shift**  
  Uncertainty in the missing‐mass calibration (relative shift of the MX² spectra between e⁺ and e⁻ data).

- **Background correction**  
  Uncertainty from the subtraction of π⁰ (and associated‐production) contamination.

- **Calorimeter calibration**  
  Uncertainty in the photon‐energy scale of the electromagnetic calorimeter.

- **Acceptance, bin width & alignment**  
  Uncertainty arising from detector acceptance, the finite φ‐bin width, and detector alignment.

The transverse‐target‐spin asymmetry amplitudes (\(A_{UT,\dots}\)) also carry an additional 8.1 % scale uncertainty due to the target‐polarization measurement, which is not included in Table 2 but is mentioned separately in the text.

*None of these uncertainties are mentioned in the Excel Sheets.*

## Table 3 Overview

In this paper, Table 3 specifies the four distinct model variants of the double‐distribution GPD ansatz whose predictions appear in Figure 5. Each variant is characterized by a choice of **t-dependence ansatz** (how the \(t\)-dependence of the generalized parton distributions is modeled) and by whether the so-called **D‐term** is included. The table then lists for each variant the two skewness‐profile parameters, **b_val** and **b_sea**, that control how the valence and sea quark distributions depend on the skewness variable.

**t-dependence Ansatz**

Two different functional forms are considered for the \(t\)-dependence of the GPDs:  
- **Factorised (Fac):** assumes the \(t\)-dependence factorises from the \(x\) and \(\xi\) dependencies.  
- **Regge-inspired (Reg):** uses a Regge-motivated parameterisation, allowing a more flexible interplay between \(t\) and the longitudinal momentum fractions.

**D-term Inclusion**

For each choice of \(t\)-dependence, the model can be built **with** or **without** the so-called **D-term**, which is an additional contribution to the GPDs required by polynomiality and associated with the distribution of forces inside the nucleon:  
- **With D-term (D):** includes the full D-term contribution.  
- **Without D-term (no D):** omits the D-term entirely.

 **Skewness-Profile Parameters**

The two parameters that govern the skewness (longitudinal momentum transfer) dependence are:  
- **b_val:** controls the profile of the **valence-quark** distribution in skewness.  
- **b_sea:** controls the profile of the **sea-quark** distribution in skewness.  

Table 3 then lists the numerical values of \(`b_val`\) and \(`b_sea`\) for each of the four combinations of t-dependence ansatz and D-term inclusion, where an “∞” entry corresponds to a flat (no skewness dependence) limit in that sector.
