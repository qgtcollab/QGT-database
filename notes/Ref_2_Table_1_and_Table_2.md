## Notes
E_lepton denotes the lepton beam energy of the beam used in the experiment (Measured at 4.25 GeV). The lepton type used in this experiment was an electron.

The hadron that was used in the experiment was a proton, with the corresponding proton resting energy constant of 0.938 GeV

Both satisfy the ep -> ep(gamma) conditon

Collaboration was done with the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS), using electroproduction data from 1999.

The tables are based off of Figure 4, page 4 in the paper, and the respective values that were used to model the function A(phi).

alpha (first harmonic): Dominant term, arising from transverse DVCS Bethe-Heitler interference.

beta (second harmonic): Smaller, twist-3 term, arising from longitudinal DVCS-BH interference

Data in the graph is set between the dependance of phi with respect to the beam symmetry, the function A(phi). There are 11 phi bins in which each is integrated in the range of Q^2 from 1.00 GeV/c^2 to 1.75 GeV/c^2 and -t from 0.1 GeV/c ^2 to 0.3 GeV/c^2. 

Relating to the Bjorken scaling regime, (the high photon virtuality, Q^2 and the  high-energy transfer at fixed Bjorken scaling variable, xB) Tables 1 & 2 have the xB and Q^2 values set at 0.19 and 1.25 (GeV/c)^2 respectivley.

Lowercase Xi is skewedness, a value not included in either tables.

t, the momentum transfer is -0.19 (GeV/c)^2 in both tables

In Table 1, the amplitude of the sin phi modulation is is 0.202, denoted under the column "value". The statistical uncertainty is 0.028, written in the table as "stat\_u". The systematic uncertainty is 0.013, written as "syst\_u".

In Table 2, the graph looks at the second harmonic, Beta*sin(2phi). Beta, the amplitude of the second harmonic is -0.024 denoted under the column "value". The statistical uncertainty is 0.021, written in the table as "stat\_u". The systematic uncertainty is 0.009, written as "syst\_u".
