# Notes
This study present final results on the photon electroproduction (ep → epγ ) cross section in the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) regime and the valence quark region from Jefferson Lab experiment E00-110

For ep→epγ kinematics, the incident beam energy E_b = 5.7572 GeV

Photon electroproduction cross sections at kinematic settings for a total of 588 experimental bins are presented. 

Kinematics Setting for Beam Energy 
| Setting  | Description                               | Notes                                     |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------- |
| Kin1     | High Q², low \( x_B \)                    | DVCS-dominated regime                     |
| Kin2     | Moderate Q², mid \( x_B \)                | Twist-3 contributions prominent           |
| Kin3     | Low Q², high \( x_B \)                    | Interference-dominated region             |
| KinX2    | Supplemental bins (mid kinematic range)   | Higher statistics near Kin2 phase space   |
| KinX3    | Supplemental bins (upper kinematic range) | Extension of Kin3 domain                  |

Results of the Q² and x_B dependencies of both the helicity-dependent and the helicity-independent cross sections are presented. 

Experiment Setup:
high luminosity in Hall A of Jefferson Lab
running at 10³⁷cm⁻²s⁻¹ --> corresponds to 2.25 μA of electron beam on a 15-cm-long liquid hydrogen target

Experimental Cuts: 
- minimum momentum for low-energy protons to go through was 305 MeV/c, corresponding to a cut on −t > 0.09 GeV²
- R value > 5 mrad

The HRS in Hall A consist of four superconducting magnets in the configuration QQDQ.

main components of the detector stack:
- a set of two scintillator planes called S1 and S2m (give very fast and good timing signals)
- two vertical drift chambers for track reconstruction
- a gas Cerenkov counter for π/e discrimination 
- a pion rejector composed of two layers of lead-glass blocks

scattered electron was detected in the Hall A left high-resolution spectrometer (HRS)
- momentum resolution δp/p=2×10⁻⁴  
- angular resolution of 2 mrad in the horizontal plane


Table 17_UU provides unpolarized DVCS cross sections in pb GeV⁻⁴ for the Kin2 and Kin3 setting. 
    The columns correspond to the values in Table VII and VIII: Q², x_B, -t, φ, \sigma_{LU}, stat and syst uncertainty

Table 17_LU provides cross-section differences for opposite beam helicities in pb GeV⁻⁴ for the Kin1, Kin2, Kin3, and Kin X2 setting. 
    The columns correspond to the values in Table IX, X, XI, and XII: Q², x_B, -t, φ, \sigma_{LU}, stat and syst uncertainty


To detect the full exclusive final state, a recoil detector was originally built to tag the DVCS proton. The proton direction for an exclusive event can be inferred from the information of the HRS and the calorimeter.
