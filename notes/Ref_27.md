The study report the first beam spin asymmetry (BSA) measurement of exclusive DVCS off a proton bound in ⁴He.

Experimental Setup

- Facility: Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab), Hall-B  
- Detector: CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) with inner calorimeter (IC) and 5 T solenoid magnet
- Beam:
  - Energy: 6.064 GeV
  - Type: Longitudinally polarized electron beam
  - Polarization: ~83%
- Target:
  - Pressurized gaseous helium-4 (⁴He)
  - Length: 292 mm
  - Diameter: 6 mm
  - Pressure: 6 atm
  - Positioned 64 cm upstream of the CLAS center

The addition of the inner calorimeter extended photon acceptance down to 4° polar angle. The solenoid magnet suppressed Møller background by steering low-energy electrons into a tungsten shield.


Reaction and Kinematics

- Process:  
   e + ⁴He ---> e' + p' + γ + X 

- DVCS off the bound proton (incoherent channel), where the nucleus breaks up and the proton is detected
- Observables:  
  - Beam spin asymmetry (BSA) \( A_{LU} \)
  - Dependence on azimuthal angle φ, Q², x_B , and t

Experimental Cuts and Event Selection

Particle Identification

- Events required to have:
  - One electron
  - One proton
  - At least one photon
- The most energetic photon was selected as the DVCS photon candidate

Kinematic Cuts

- Q² > 1 GeV²
- Invariant mass \( W > 2 GeV
- t > t_min

Exclusivity Cuts

- Based on four-momentum conservation in:
  \[
  e + p ---> e' + p' + γ
  \]
- Cuts applied on:
  - Coplanarity angle Δϕ
  - Missing energy
  - Missing mass squared
  - Missing transverse momentum
  - Cone angle (θ) between measured and calculated photon direction

Background Rejection

- π⁰ background rejected by identifying two-photon invariant mass
- Accidental background estimated by selecting events from different vertices
  - Accounted for 6.5% of events
- π⁰ ---> γγ contamination estimated via Monte Carlo and subtracted (8–10% depending on bin)

---

Data and Binning

- Final dataset: ~30,000 DVCS events
- Binned in:
  - 4 bins in either Q², x_B , or -t
  - 9 bins in azimuthal angle φ

---

Results
- Found BSA for bound protons is 20%–40% lower than for free protons across all bins
