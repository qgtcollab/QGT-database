# Notes
This study presents beam-helicity and beam-charge asymmetries from the hard exclusive leptoproduction of real photons via deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) on an unpolarised hydrogen gas target internal to the Hera lepton storage ring at Desy.

Beam: Longitudinally polarised electrons and positrons at 27.6 GeV  
Selection: Missing-mass technique applied to identify exclusive events

The lepton type(s) used in this experiment were both electrons and positrons.

The experiment was conducted by the HERMES Collaboration at DESY. This analysis uses a combined data set collected over the years 1996-2007 at Hermes for each t,xB and Q² bin.

Data are taken from Tables 5 and 6 (page 18) of the paper

Kinematic requirements:

- 1 < Q² < 10 (GeV/c)²

- 0.03 < x_b < 0.35

- W² > 9 GeV²

- ν < 22 GeV

-  -t < 0.7 GeV²

approximately integrated luminosities of data samples:
electron: 246pb⁻¹ 
positron: 1460pb⁻¹, 

average beam polarisations:
electron: 0303  
positron: 0392 

The recoiling proton was not detected. Exclusive events were selected by requiring the squared missing mass M_X² of the reaction ep → e′γX to be within the following ranges:

- angle cut: 5 mrad < θ_{γ*γ} < 45 mrad

- missing-mass-squared cut: –1.5 < M_X² < 1.7 (GeV/c²)²

This work focuses on beam-helicity asymmetries (A_LU) and beam-charge asymmetries (A_C). The amplitudes of the azimuthal modulations of these asymmetries provide constraints on Compton Form Factors (CFFs), particularly H, H̃, and mathcalE

The leading-twist amplitudes A_LU,I 
sinφ, A_C cos(0φ), and A_C cosφ are of primary interest.

Table 1 Overview
Table 1 of the paper (page 7) provides a summary of the physically-motivated asymmetry amplitudes, the Fourier coefficients they relate to, their dominant C-function dependence, and the twist-level of the contributing GPDs. This establishes the theoretical basis for interpreting the experimental results.

A_LU,I sinφ, A_C cos(0φ), and A_C cosφ are leading-twist (twist-2) and provide the main sensitivity to the GPD H via the CFF 
mathcalC_unp 
I
 .

A_LU,I sin(2φ) and A_C cos(2φ) are twist-3 amplitudes.

A_C cos(3φ) is a twist-2 amplitude but is suppressed as it relates to gluon helicity-flip GPDs.

Table 2 of the paper (page 9) details the systematic uncertainties for the 2006-2007 data set for the overall kinematic bin. The total systematic uncertainty is formed by adding the following contributions in quadrature:

Background Correction: Uncertainty from semi-inclusive and exclusive neutral meson production.

Missing-Mass Shift: Uncertainty from observed shifts in the M_X² distributions between electron and positron data.

Detector Effects: A combined uncertainty from spectrometer acceptance, resolution, alignment, and finite bin widths, estimated using Monte Carlo simulations.

The beam-helicity asymmetries (A_LU) have an additional scale uncertainty from the beam polarization measurement (3.4% for 2006-2007 data, 3.2% for the combined 1996-2007 data), which is not included in the table.
