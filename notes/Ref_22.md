## Notes

**THIS REFERENCE DOES NOT HAVE A CORRESPONDING DATA TABLE**

The lepton beam energies of the beam used in the experiment (measured at two beam energies, E=4.45 and 5.55GeV GeV).  
The lepton type(s) used in this experiment were electrons.

The hadron used in the experiment was a proton, with a rest-energy constant of 0.938 GeV.

Both satisfy the en→enγ condition.

Collaboration was done with Jefferson Lab Hall A.

Since there is no table in this article, the cuts/kinematic requirements shall be included in slightly greater detail here.

1. Kinematic Requirements
   - -0.15 < -t < -0.45 GeV^2
   - t′=tmin−t∈[0, 0.3]GeV^2
   - 0.5GeV^2 < M_X^2 < 0.95GeV2
   - **π⁰ contamination subtraction:**  
  Simulated π⁰→γγ decays are used to estimate and subtract single-photon backgrounds, following equation (6) of the paper.

   - **Kinematic separation of channels:**  
  The coherent d(e,e′γ)d and quasifree n(e,e′γ)n contributions are kinematically split by a shift  
  \(\Delta M_X^2 \approx t\,(1 - M_N/M_d) \approx t/2\),  
  and the exclusive data are binned in \(\phi\), beam energy \(E\), \(t\), and \(M_X^2\) to exploit this separation.
