## Notes  
This study measured the beam-spin azimuthal asymmetry in hard exclusive electroproduction of photons, primarily associated with the interference between Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) and Bethe-Heitler (BH) processes.

Data were collected using the 27.6 GeV longitudinally polarized positron beam at HERA/DESY, with an unpolarized hydrogen gas target, via the HERMES spectrometer.

The asymmetry is measured in the azimuthal angle \(\phi\), relative to the lepton scattering plane, and is defined in terms of beam helicity. The beam-spin analyzing power in the sinφ moment was:

- \( A^{\sin\phi}_{LU} = -0.23 \pm 0.04_{\text{stat}} \pm 0.03_{\text{syst}} \)

Experimental Conditions:
- Beam Energy: 27.6 GeV (positron beam)
- Target: Hydrogen gas (unpolarized)
- Average \( Q^2 \): 2.6 GeV\(^2\)
- Average \( x_B \): 0.11
- Average \( |t| \): 0.27 GeV\(^2\)
- Beam polarization \( P_l \): 55%

Events were selected based on missing mass with a beam-spin azimuthal asymmetry observed for \( M_x \lesssim 1.7 \) GeV.

Experimental Cuts for Events Detected by Calorimeter:
- one positron track with t > 3.5 GeV
- one photon with energy deposition > 0.8 GeV 

positron kinematics: 

Q^2 > 1 GeV^2 
W^2 > 4 GeV^2
v < 24 GeV

For fig. 3 - Beam-spin asymmetry A_LU for hard electroproduction of photons as a function of the azimuthal angle φ:
-  4015 events with selected missing mass between 21.5 and 11.7 GeV
- asymmetric M_x range chosen to minimize the inﬂuence of the DIS-fragmentation background
- for selected M_x range, proton and △(1232) resonance are included 

The data were compared with theoretical predictions based on Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs).

- The sign flips with beam helicity
- π⁰ contamination estimated to be ≤12.5%
- Instrumental asymmetries are negligible
