## Notes
The study measured the magnitude and phase of the DVCS amplitude to perform three-dimensional (3D) images of the proton internal structure. It reports accurate measurements of the photon electroproduction ep → epγ cross section of a polarized electron beam of energy k off an unpolarized proton target.

Experiment:
measurements of helicity dependent and helicity-independent photon electroproduction cross sections with high statistical accuracy in Hall A of Jefferson Lab at two values of beam energy and three values of Q²

For experiment E07–007:
- longitudinally polarized electron beam impinged on a 15-cm-long liquid H2 target
- beam polarization was continuously measured by the Hall A Compton polarimeter and found to be 72 ± 2 %_sys on average
- left high-resolution spectrometer (HRS) detected scattered e⁻
- events were triggered by the coincidence of a scintillator plane (S2m) and a signal in a gas Cerenkov counter
        
        electron kinematics ---> momentum resolution of HRS: δp/p ~ 10⁻⁴ 
        interaction vertex ---> horizontal angular resolution: δθ ~ 0.6 mr
 - final state photon was detected in an electromagnetic calorimeter consisting on an 16 × 13 array of PbF2 crystals
     energy resolution measured: 2.4% at 4.2GeV with ~3mm spatial resolution

Experimental Cuts:
- 800 MeV energy cut on the photon to remove most of the accidental background
- Mₓ² > 0.5 GeV² to increase the signal/background ratio
- Mₓ² < 1 GeV²


beam energies: E_lepton = 3.355, 4.455, and 5.55 GeV

Table 6 Excel file corresponds to the following:
- E_lepton = 4.455 GeV
- x_B = 0.357 and x_B = 0.358 for Q² = 1.74 GeV²
- x_B = 0.361 for Q² = 1.76 GeV²

Conclusion: For the helicity-dependent cross section, there is a significant DVCS² contribution in the higher-twist (HT) scenario.
