## Notes
Systematic uncertainties are treated as 85% correlated by private communication with Stefan Schmitt from H1. This is what is written in the column "syst_c".

Then, we take the sqrt(1-0.85*0.85) * systematic_uncertainty to be the uncorrelated part of the systematic uncertainty. This is what is written in the column "syst_u".
