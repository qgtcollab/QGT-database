## Notes
This dataset reports DVCS cross-section measurements for the process \( e^+ p \rightarrow e^+ \gamma p \). Data were collected with the H1 Detector at HERA for proton beam energies of 820 GeV (Table 1a) and 920 GeV (Table 1b).

Measurements of squared momentum transfer at the proton vertex \( t \), at fixed values of \( Q^2 \) and \( W \) in each table, are:

- Table 1a: 
  - \( Q^2 = 4.0 \, \mathrm{GeV}^2 \), \( W = 71.0 \, \mathrm{GeV} \)  
  - \( t \)-range: [–0.1, –0.8] \( \mathrm{GeV}^2 \)  
  - Decreasing cross-section with increasing \( |t| \) --> exponential slope .

- Table 1b:  
  - \( Q^2 = 8.0 \, \mathrm{GeV}^2 \), \( W = 82.0 \, \mathrm{GeV} \)  
  - \( t \)-range: [-0.1, –0.8] \( \mathrm{GeV}^2 \)  
  - Slope is shallower for Q^2 = 8.0 than Q^2 = 4.0.

From figure 4, the cross sections follow an exponential form:  
\[
\frac{d\sigma}{dt} \propto e^{-b|t|}, \quad \text{with } b \approx 5.82 +- 0.59 +-0.50 \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-2} \text{ at } Q^2 = 8.0 \, \mathrm{GeV}^2
\]

Model comparison used included the Generalized Parton Distributions (GPD). The dipole cross section is parameterised using Donnachie and Dosch's approach for soft and hard pomeron exchange and Bartels, Golec-Biernat and Kowalski (BGBK).

Data

- Beam energies used:  
  - Lepton beam: 27.6 GeV (positron)  
  - Proton beam: 820 GeV (Table 1a), 920 GeV (Table 1b)

- Data represent the first squared momentum transfer\( t \)-differential DVCS measurements at high energies (820 GeV and 920 Gev). This is used to constrain proton structure through GPDs.
