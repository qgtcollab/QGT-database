## Notes
Experiment Overview
- Process: ep \rightarrow ep\gamma — GPD accessible through DVCS with interference from Bethe-Heitler (BH)
- Facility: Jefferson Lab Hall A, using a 5.75 GeV polarized electron beam (∼76%) on a liquid hydrogen target
- Goal: Extract twist-2 and twist-3 contributions to DVCS and demonstrate twist-2 dominance

 Measurements
- Helicity-Dependent Cross Section (d^4 \Sigma):
Sensitive to the imaginary part of the BH-DVCS interference
Demonstrated strong \sin \phi dependence, consistent with leading-twist behavior
- Helicity-Independent Cross Section (d^4 \sigma):
Probes the real part of the interference
Revealed deviations from pure BH expectations, confirming the presence of DVCS

Kinematics and Setup
| Variable       | Values | 
| Q^2            | 1.5–2.3 GeV^2 | 
| x_B            | 0.36 | 
| -t Range       | 0.17–0.33 GeV^2 (from Table 2)| 
| Calorimeter    | PbF_2 photon detector array | 
| Angle Coverage | Full \phi coverage (Trento convention) | 



Results — Angular Harmonics Fit
| Observable                                     | Notation                | Twist | Highlights | 
| \mathrm{Im}[C^\mathcal{I}(F)]                  | Imaginary Part          | 2     | Flat vs. Q^2, confirms twist-2 dominance | 
| \mathrm{Im}[C^\mathcal{I}(F_{\text{eff}})]     | Imaginary (twist-3)     | 3     | Small, indicating subleading role | 
| \mathrm{Re}[C^\mathcal{I}(F)]                  | Real Part               | 2     | Revealed strong t-dependence | 
| \mathrm{Re}[(C + \Delta C)^\mathcal{I}(F)]     | Real Interference Combo | 2     | Larger than predictions, needs theoretical tuning | 



Interpretation
- Twist-2 Dominance: No significant Q^2 dependence in \mathrm{Im}[C^\mathcal{I}(F)]
→ Confirms GPDs are accessible at moderate Q^2
- GPD Sensitivity:
- Imaginary part reflects GPDs at x = \xi
- Real part encodes integrals over full x domain
- Comparison with VGG Model:
 agrees with imaginary component,
but underestimated real parts of the angular harmonics
