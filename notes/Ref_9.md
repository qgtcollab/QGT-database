## Notes
The data presented in Table 4 is derived from Table 4 on page 9. It details the DVCS differential cross section, dσ^(γ∗p→γp)/dt, as a function of |t|. Values are quoted at the centre of each |t| bin and for Q² = 3.2 GeV² and W = 104 GeV. The first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic.

Experiment:

For this study, DVCS in, γ∗p → γp, was measured in e⁺p collisions at HERA with the ZEUS detector using an integrated luminosity of 61.1 pb⁻¹. HERA collided positrons of energy 27.5 GeV with protons of energy 920 GeV.

phase space: Q² > 1.5 GeV2 and 40 < W < 170 GeV

The study presents a subsample of events in which the scattered proton is measured in the ZEUS leading proton spectrometer (LPS), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 31.3 pb⁻¹. This is used for the direct measurement of the t dependence of the DVCS cross section.

Charged particles were tracked in the CTD.

CTD setting:
- magnetic field of 1.43 T provided by a thin solenoid
- 72 cylindrical drift-chamber layers, organised in nine superlayers covering the polar angle region 15◦ < θ < 164◦

Experimental Cuts for 2 isolated electromagnetic (EM) clusters with E > 2 GeV:

- first cluster was required to be in the RCAL with energy E₁ > 10 GeV
- second cluster had to have a polar angle θ₂ < 2.85 rad 
   - required to be either in the RCAL with  E₂ > 3 GeV or in the BCAL with E₂ > 2.5 GeV
- 40 < E − P_Z < 70 GeV
